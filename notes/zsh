 Zsh Configuration Information:
    
    Main terminal configurations are stored in ~/.zshrc.
    
        The .zshrc stores important startup configurations, including sourcing functions and aliases and setting up Oh-My-Zsh plugins and themes
        The ~/.zshrc_local file is also sourced at the end, which allows for machine specific aliases and functions
        Some configurations are stored in ~/.zprofile, but it is reserved for use when needed
